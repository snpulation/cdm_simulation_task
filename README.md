## git commands cheatsheet
when you've completed a feature, make sure to 
1. `fetch` to keep your git tree up to date
2. `pull` if there were any changes made the remote version of your branch
3. `add` your files 
4. write a `commit` message (-m)
5. `push` your changes 


```
// a summary of what's going on: current branch, unsynced changes, etc
git status

// change branch 
// alternatively, right-click branch on Git Graph >> Checkout Branch
git checkout <branch_name>

// "refresh": make sure your git tree is up to date and you can see changes made by everyone else remotely
// alternatively, cloud+downward-arrow button on Git Graph 
git fetch

// "download" changes from the remote to your local 
// alternatively, use the Source Control tab in VS Code
git pull origin <branch_name>

// tell git which files you made changes to and it include in your next commit
// alternatively, the + buttons in the Source Control tab in VS Code
git add <filename>

// describe your changes clearly and concisely
// alternatively, the message box in the Source Control tab in VS Code >> the Commit button
git commit -m "<commit message>"

// "upload" your changes to the remote so everyone can see them
// alternatively, the Sync Changes / Publish button in the Source Control tab in VS Code
git push origin <branch_name>
```
